<strong>HTML Semantics and Scouts Rule! </strong> 

In this project, the task at hand was to clean up any unnecessary code and make the HTML page more comprehensible by better defining the different sections and layout of web page.  

This project was useful by the continuous research for HTML semantics and the issues faced through the many trials and errors. This showed the importance for front end developers on how this can be crucial for them and the user experience.
