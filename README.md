HTML Semantic and Scouts Rule! 

In this project, I was instructed to clean up any unnessacry code and making the HTML page more comprehensible by better defining the different sections and layout of web page.

This project was so useful by having me continuously researching the use of HTML semantics and the issues I faced through the trial and errors. I learned the importance of why as front end developers this can be crucial an helpful to others and yourself.
